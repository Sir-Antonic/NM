We will now repeat this process again for P2. This time we will repeat [[Step 17]] - [[Step 19]] again, but this time we need to look up the values for 8006B520. 

>[!Note]
>This Address is the 8Bit version of P2's animation data address - 8106B520. 

You should see the value you need beside an address that says 8006b520 : The First 4 digits/letters, (in the 00 Column) after this address should be the first values we need for P2 (which in this case is 00BA). Write these values down.
