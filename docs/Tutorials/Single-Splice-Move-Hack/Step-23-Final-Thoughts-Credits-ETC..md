Now If you're wondering, 

- Why is P1 exploding and how do I fix it? 
- How do I change the frame the move animation changes? 
- Why is P2 flipping from his Stomach to his Back at the end of the move.
- Why is my move not matching the ring/rope bounce that occurs?
- ETC ETC

These are all great questions that all have answers but for this basic intro to move hacking, they are a little too advanced. So they will get their own write up. So keep a look out for follow up tutorials that cover things like cleaning up your move hacks. fixing issues, and/or how to do more advanced stuff.

[SirAntonic](https://twitter.com/SirAntonic), That would be me, like I said before, the original tutorial was not done by me, but I did spend alot of time trying to update,reword, and rework the tutorial for a newer set of move hackers. I also made all the gifs and added the Definitions and Info you see to try to help others understand some of the terminology.
