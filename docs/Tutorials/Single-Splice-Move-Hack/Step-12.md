We will now repeat the same process we just did, but for P2. P2 has a different set of Addresses we will need to use but we can use the same steps as we did before during [[Step 09]] - [[Step 11]], The Address we need to look up this time to get P2's Values is 8006B514. 

**Click for [[Step 13]]**

>[!Note]
>This Address is the 8Bit version of P2's first address we will use in our code - D106B514.

You should see the values you need beside an address that says 8006B514 : The First 4 digits/letters after this address in column 00 should be the first value we need for P2 (which should be, in this ex. 37B0). Write these values down.
